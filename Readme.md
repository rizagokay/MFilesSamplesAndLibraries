# M-Files Samples and Libraries

*Please read the attached [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) file for detailed information.*

This solution contains a series of libraries and samples to help developers build applications using [M-Files](http://www.m-files.com).  These libraries and samples are designed to sit alongside our dedicated [M-Files Developer Portal](http://developer.m-files.com), where further information on the APIs and Frameworks that M-Files expose can be found.

Whilst the code aims to be as compatible as possible, please note that this is currently tested using the following configuration:

* The latest public M-Files build (currently M-Files 2018)
* Visual Studio 2015 Update 3

**We expect people interacting with this repository to follow our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and have published [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).**

## Visual Studio solutions

Two Visual Studio solution files (`.sln`) are available within this repository: `MFSamplesAndLibraries` and `MFWSSamplesAndLibraries`.

* `MFSamplesAndLibraries` is a solution containing all samples and libraries, and can be used to easily open and investigate the entire codebase.  This requires that you have the latest M-Files build installed on your development machine.
* `MFWSSamplesAndLibraries` contains only the libraries and samples used to access the M-Files Web Service.  This solution does not require the M-Files client to be installed.

## Libraries
